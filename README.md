# RouterPi-extender
I was attempting to create a router repeater using the raspberry pi. I found some articles and walk throuhgs, they may have worked on raspbian, but didn't work for me on my kali pi. So I decided to create my own ap to both work as travel router and repeater. In the walk through I will enumerate my procces of both understanding and developing the AP/routerPi and I will create a automated setup for the conslusion of my findings
