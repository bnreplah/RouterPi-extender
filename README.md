# RouterPi-extender
The Raspbery Pi extender is a Multi Pronged Project.

The first part of the project consists of building a Wireless Acess point from a Raspberry Pi. This includes setting up dnsmasq which assigns ip addresses to all the clients that connect to the host.

The second part of the project consists of setting up NAT traffic fowarding to forward the internet traffic out over the internet connection and back. This allows the Raspberry pi to act as an wifi extender, repeater and wireless bridge.
